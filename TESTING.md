For the testing, the first path goes through 
1. Registers successfully
2. Creates a new listing successfully
3. Updates the thumbnail and title of the listing successfully
4. Publish a listing successfully
5. Unpublish a listing successfully
6. Make a booking successfully
7. Logs out of the application successfully
8. Logs back into the application successfully

with all those cases already covered,
we wanted to test the following cases:
1. Host logins successfully
2. Creates a new listing successfully with different prices
3. Publish a listing successfully with different availabilities
4. Other user successfully searches for a listing
5. Other user successfully books the listing twice 
6. Host successfully accepts one booking and rejects the other 
7. Other user successfully leaves a review
