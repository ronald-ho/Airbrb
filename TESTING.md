For the testing, the first path goes through

1. Registers successfully
2. Creates a new listing successfully
3. Updates the thumbnail and title of the listing successfully
4. Publish a listing successfully
5. Unpublish a listing successfully
6. Make a booking successfully
7. Logs out of the application successfully
8. Logs back into the application successfully

with all those cases already covered,
we wanted to test the following cases:

1. Host logins successfully
2. Creates a new listing successfully with different prices
3. Publish a listing successfully with different availabilities
4. Other user successfully searches for a listing
5. Other user successfully books the listing twice
6. Host successfully accepts one booking and rejects the other
7. Other user successfully leaves a review

the main points that we tested was that the search function was successfully implemented
and that users are able to search for listings using booking dates.
this pathway also allows the user to book for a listing twice, and shows that the host is able to
accept one booking and reject the other.
Finally, the user is able to leave a review for the listing.
