The nav bar is responsive - separate versions for desktop and mobile for best user experience.
The buttons are intuitively named - while 'My Listings' is visible for logged out users, it leads to a screen indicating that the user needs to login to access additional features.
The 'Airbnb' logo on desktop view is also clickable and leads to the landing page.

At the landing page, the accepted and pending listing cards are colour coded. 
Owners can't see their own listing on this page to avoid confusion.
If a listing has multiple images or embeded Youtube links, you can flick through them without having to open the listing.

When viewing a listing, you can only request to book if you are not the owner of the listing. Similarly, the option to leave a review is only available to non-owners of a given listing.

When choosing which listing to publish/see the bookings for, hosts are able to see a simplified version of the listing card in the drop down selection
They are able to see the listing thumbnail, title, price per night, property type, and number of beds and baths
