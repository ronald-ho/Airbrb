We made our website more accessible by:

Adding labels to inputs, buttons, and images

We also added numerical labels for SVG ratings that states the rating out of 5.

Care was also taken when selecting our component library. Accessibility was a priority and we believe ChakraUI is a great choice for this.

Our colour scheme was very simple - red for key buttons, and then black/white combos for high contrast.

All screens are made responsive and mobile device friendly.

font sizes were chosen to be easy to view, no extra small font sizes
